    <img src="chai.jpg" alt="A cup of Tea" width="210">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The recipe  above is for a classic Indian Masala Chai (Spiced Tea). It is the most popular style of tea preparation in India, distinct because the tea leaves are actively boiled with milk and water, rather than just being steeped in hot water like Western teas.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>water- 2 cups</li>
        <li>Chai Patti(Black Tea)</li>
        <li>Sugar( as per taste)</li>
        <li>Milk- 2 cups</li>
        <li>Masala(a mix of diffrent spices e.g. Ginger, Cardamom etc</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong> Water and Spices:</strong> In a saucepan, add the water, crushed ginger, and cardamom (and other spices if using). Bring this to a boil on medium heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Tea Leaves:</strong>  Add the black tea leaves. Let the water simmer for about 1–2 minutes. The water should turn a dark reddish-brown color</li>
        <li><strong>Add Milk and Sugar:</strong> Pour in the milk and add the sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Double Boil:</strong>  Turn the heat up and let the tea come to a rolling boil. As it rises to the rim, turn the heat down to low so it settles. Repeat this process (boiling up and settling down) 2 or 3 times.</li>
        <li><strong>Strain and Serve:</strong>  Turn off the heat. Use a fine-mesh strainer (channi) to pour the tea into cups. Serve piping hot.</li>
